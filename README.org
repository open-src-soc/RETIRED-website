+ =stack=.  Follow install instructions at https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install.

* build tools [developer, integrator]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ TMPDIR=DIR_WITH_LOTS_OF_SPACE_AVAILABLE stack setup
$ make stack_build
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can skip =make stack_build=.  =make all= builds everything,
including the build tools.

* build the website [developer, integrator]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

The website files are build in the directory =_site=.

It's also possible to have the website automatically built each time
a source file is modified.  Open your browser to =http://localhost:8000=,
and then run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make watch
#+END_EXAMPLE

To rebuild everything in =_site=:
#+begin_example
$ make rebuild
#+end_example

* deploy [integrator]

This build rule rebuilds everything, pushes the website contents in
directory =site=, and =git push= to =site='s remote.  The directory
=site= is intended to be a git submodule.  If the website is hosted on
=github.io= (or similar services) =git push=ing its contents will
update the contents of the website.

#+begin_example
$ make deploy
#+end_example

* to merge, build the site, push and sync everything

While in the branch =master=, to merge all in branch =deploy=, commit
=deploy=, merge back in =master= and push both branches:

#+begin_example
$ make commit-merge-and-push-both-branches
#+end_example
