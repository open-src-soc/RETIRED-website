## What does the space industry expect from RISC-V?

By [Antoine Certain]()([Airbus Defence & Space]())

The space industry has some particularities which makes the usage of COTS
components quite difficult. But, with the emergence of new space designs based
on COTS, the space industry open its doors to a bigger ecosystem. And the RISC V
ecosystem could answer to the major requirements of spacecraft design. This
presentation will present the main requirements such industry expect from a
core IP.

*Antoine CERTAIN is an experienced hardware and software architect on embedded
 data-handling applications on spacecraft. He has gained large scale of space
 knowledge thanks to several projects for ESA, CNES and internally to Airbus
 Defence and Space. He is now team leader of the R&D On board data processing
 team of Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, FR.

## Achieving determinism and performance on the RISC-V FlexPRET Processor

By [Eric Jenn]()([IRT Saint-Exupéry](http://www.irt-saintexupery.com/))

Performance improvement usually comes at the cost of temporal determinism.
Trading better average performance for a loss of predictability is sometimes
acceptable, but it is not for safety-critical applications where the time at
which a value is produced is often as important as the value itself. In this
talk, we address the question of temporal determinism, which is a prerequisite
to dependability. We show how we combine a deterministic programming model with
a deterministic hardware architecture and an “holistic” optimization process to
achieve both performance and dependability. This work is applied on the
MultiPRET processor, a "multicore" declination of the RiscV FlexPRET PREcision
Timed Architecture (PRET) proposed by the University of California at Berkeley.

*Dr Eric Jenn is a research engineer at Thales AVS. He is currently managing the
 Critical Applications on Predictable High-Performance Computing Architectures
 (CAPHCA) collaborative research project at IRT Saint-Exupéry in Toulouse. Dr
 Jenn has been working in the area of safety critical systems for around 30
 years, both on the analysis and development of nuclear and avionics systems. His
 interests cover all aspects of the development of dependable real-time systems,
 including certification, system modeling and design, real-time software
 development, formal verification, and microarchitecture design. He has
 participated in many collaborative research projects involving academic and
 industrial partners, including GUARDS, Diana, SPICES, ESPASS, P, etc.
